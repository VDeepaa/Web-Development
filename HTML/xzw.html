 <p>Maggi, one of the classic two-minute dishes, is making headlines again, this time for yet another reason but with a unique twist. 

  The latest viral video, combining the all-time favourite noodles with the Indian bread - roti- took Maggi lovers by storm, who reacted to the social media post. Maggi has always been the focus for new inventive ways of enjoying the savoury dish; from new inventions involving vegetables, gol gappa, and chips to now roti, this dish has seen it all.
  
  A user on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) shared a video of the ultimate combination of Maggi with roti, which has thrown netizens into a frenzy. The viral video showcases the epitome of Desi Jugaad. The clip shows the hostel girl and her roommate devouring Maggi with roti instead of sabzi. </p>
 <p>Over the bizarre food combination, a user stated, “When maggi came to India initially people used to eat it as a sabji." A second user commented, "If u are already trying this please add some chocolate syrup too.”

  Another user remarked, “I tried this 1yr ago its definitely taste good.” A fourth user said, “Maggi with Rice and punjabi tadka. Also a great combination.” A fifth user noted, “Maggi is used as everything except the way its supposed to be used.”</p>
